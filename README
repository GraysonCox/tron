I made a Tron game, which was one of the suggestions in the assignment description.
The game ends when a player has won 3 rounds or when ^q is entered.

MAIN MENU CONTROLS:
  Move cursor - Arrow keys
  Select option - Space bar

PLAYER 1 CONTROLS:
  Movement - Arrow keys
  Boost - '/'
  
PLAYER 2 CONTROLS:
  Movement - wasd
  Boost - 'e'
